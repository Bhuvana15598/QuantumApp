This repository is organized to follow my progression from quantum logic to hardware simulation.

1-Basics:
  Focus: Foundational Principles & Quantum States The starting point of my journey. These projects focus on mastering the Q# syntax and the fundamental behavior of qubits.

Key Projects: Hello World, Single & Multi-Qubit Coin Flips (Superposition), and Anticorrelation.

Mastery: Understanding state measurement and the "destructive" nature of observing quantum data.

2-Quantum-Logic:
  Focus: Multi-Qubit Operations & Algorithms Moving beyond single qubits to explore how they interact. These projects demonstrate the unique "speed-up" capabilities of quantum systems.

Key Projects: Entanglement (Bell States), Quantum Teleportation, and the Deutsch Algorithm.

Mastery: Implementing non-classical correlations and using interference to solve problems more efficiently than classical logic.

3-Applications:
  Focus: Practical Quantum Use-Cases Applying quantum mechanics to solve specific functional problems.

Key Projects: Quantum Vault.

Mastery: Using quantum measurement logic to build a "secure locker" that detects intruders through state collapse.

4-Hardware-Diagnostics:
  Focus: Fabrication Simulation & Reliability Engineering This section reflects my interest in the hardware side of the stack. I simulate "noisy" environments to test how virtual hardware performs during fabrication.

Key Projects: Crosstalk Leakage, T1 Decay Tests, and Targeted Qubit Health Checks.

Mastery: Using stochastic simulations to estimate wafer yield and identifying how environmental noise impacts qubit reliability.
